# leaflet-challenge1

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) data was used to visualize earthquake data. A map that plots all the earthquakes based on longitude and latitude were created using leaflet. The data markers were made to reflect the maginitude of the earthquake based on their size and depth of the earthquake by color. The earthquakes with higher magnitude will appear larger while the earthquakes with greater depth will be darker in color.
